#IS2545 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing
### Wang pittID:siw20

**1. The challenge for this project**

  1 Use Object Oriented Design
    * I designed two classes
    * Citylocations used to store general location info
    * Visitor class and its subclasses used to build the four kind of visitors
  2 Write testable code
  	* It is very chanllenging to write method that return a value I can test on.
  	* I am not used to TDD. Usually I write the code directly, but writing test before code is difficult for me.
